# Expense Tracker Project

## Overview

We developed a small Expense Tracker application as part of our project. The aim was to create a simple yet effective tool for tracking expenses while learning and improving our collaboration and project management skills.

## Communication Channels
To facilitate effective communication, we decided early on to:

- Create a WhatsApp group and a Discord server for ongoing discussions and quick updates.
- Hold bi-weekly meetings to align on goals and progress.

## Workflow Improvements
Initially, we held regular meetings every two weeks. However, after setting up GitHub Issues and Actions, we noticed that the task tracking and automated workflows made it easier to coordinate asynchronously. This allowed us to:

- Reduce the frequency of meetings
- Clearly track what each team member was working on
- Divide tasks more effectively

## Technology Choices & Decision-Making Process
We made fundamental technology decisions based on project requirements:

- **Frameworks and Tools:** Instead of relying solely on what we were familiar with, we selected tools that best met the needs of the project.
- **Philosophy:** Tools and frameworks should assist the team, not constrain it. Each project deserves the most appropriate tools, even if it means learning something new.
